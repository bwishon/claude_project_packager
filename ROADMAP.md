# Project Packager Improvements

A focused roadmap of enhancements to improve AI assistance for solo development workflow.

## Priority 1: Code Analysis Metadata

The following improvements will help the AI assistant provide more accurate and contextual code suggestions:

- Add language summary showing percentage breakdown of programming languages used
  - Helps AI understand project composition to give language-appropriate advice
  - Enables suggestions for standardizing language usage across project
  - Assists in identifying potential areas for modernization

- Extract dependency information from package files
  - Enables AI to identify outdated or security-risk dependencies
  - Helps with compatibility checking for new feature suggestions
  - Allows for dependency rationalization recommendations

- Basic code quality metrics
  - Lines of code per file/function to identify overly complex areas
  - Comment ratio to find under-documented sections
  - Cyclomatic complexity to highlight areas needing refactoring
  - Helps AI suggest targeted improvements

## Priority 2: Enhanced File Metadata

These enhancements will improve the AI's understanding of code organization and relationships:

- Add function/class level information
  - Method signatures and parameters
  - Class hierarchies and inheritance relationships
  - Helps AI understand code structure for better refactoring advice
  - Enables more accurate suggestions for new features

- Track import/dependency relationships between files
  - Shows internal code dependencies
  - Helps identify potential circular dependencies
  - Assists AI in suggesting better code organization
  - Makes refactoring suggestions safer

- Code documentation coverage
  - Track which functions/classes are documented
  - Identify critical areas needing documentation
  - Helps AI suggest documentation improvements
  - Enables AI to maintain documentation standards

## Priority 3: Contextual Information

These features will help the AI better understand project context and requirements:

- README content parsing
  - Extract project purpose and goals
  - Identify key features and requirements
  - Helps AI align suggestions with project objectives
  - Enables more relevant feature recommendations

- Track TODO/FIXME comments
  - Collect and categorize development tasks
  - Highlight areas needing attention
  - Helps AI prioritize improvement suggestions
  - Makes technical debt more visible

- Parse build configuration
  - Understand deployment requirements
  - Identify environment dependencies
  - Helps AI with deployment-related suggestions
  - Enables better CI/CD recommendations

## Priority 4: Testing Infrastructure

Improvements to help maintain code quality:

- Add test coverage data
  - Track which code paths are tested
  - Identify untested functionality
  - Helps AI suggest relevant test cases
  - Enables better test maintenance advice

- Test file associations
  - Link test files to source code
  - Track test-to-code ratios
  - Helps AI maintain test coverage
  - Makes test organization clearer

## Implementation Notes

When implementing these improvements:
1. Focus on non-intrusive data collection that doesn't affect project structure
2. Prioritize performance to handle large codebases efficiently
3. Ensure error handling degrades gracefully if data can't be collected
4. Keep output format extensible for future enhancements
5. Maintain compatibility with existing automation

## Future Considerations

Lower priority improvements that may be valuable later:
- Multiple output formats for different AI models
- Incremental update support for large projects
- Project template analysis
- Performance profiling data
- Security scanning integration

## Timeline

This is a living document that will be updated as improvements are implemented. Track progress in the project's issue tracker.

## Contributing

When implementing these improvements:
1. Create an issue first to discuss implementation approach
2. Add appropriate error handling
3. Include performance considerations
4. Update documentation
5. Add new tests as needed
